Computer Animation and Visualisation: Assignment 1
Pengfei Gao, s1144374

First I build a tree structure to save all the joints and find the bones.
The 0 joint is to be root of the tree.
All the joints coordinates are the local coordinates while he root joint coordinates is (0,0,0) and the root joint is initiately being translated to (-0.0881862,-0.2236780,-0.9295360) which is the default position. 
Read the weights from the file and calculate the the linear blending using the equations provided. Each time calculation is according to the initiate coordinates.
I implemented the vertex three rotation functions for x,y,z axises. 
I create a Frame struct which stores the translate coordinates and rotation angles for each joint. The translate rotations remains same all the time because the bones are a fixed length. Each joint's angles will affect its child joints positions. The world positions are calculated using the provided equations.
I used the linear interpolation keyframes to compute 18 frames between two keyframes.
I wrote a keyboard function to display simple animations to respond to user key-press event:
'w' for walk,
'a' for attack,
's' for jump,
'd' for defend,
'space' for stop animation,
'esc' for quit.
